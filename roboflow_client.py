"""
Asynchronous client for interacting with a Roboflow inference workflow.

The Roboflow API can return predictions for uploaded images along with an
annotated image.  This module defines a ``RoboflowClient`` class that
encapsulates the logic for submitting a single JPEG image to a workflow
endpoint and parsing the response.  Calls are made using ``aiohttp`` to
allow many images to be processed concurrently.

Environment variables
=====================

Two environment variables control how the client connects to the API:

``ROBOFLOW_API_KEY``
    Your Roboflow API key.  Do **not** hardâ€‘code this value; instead set
    it in your shell environment or via a `.env` file.  The API key is
    appended as a query parameter when invoking the workflow.

``ROBOFLOW_WORKFLOW_ID``
    The identifier of your workflow.  This corresponds to the workflow
    slug configured in your Roboflow workspace.  The endpoint URL is
    built from this value.  Refer to Roboflow's documentation for the
    exact format of workflow endpoints.

Response format assumptions
===========================

The code assumes that the response JSON includes:

* A ``predictions`` field containing a list of bounding boxes.  Each
  prediction should have a ``class`` key whose value is one of
  ``"buck"``, ``"deer"`` or ``"doe"``:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  The client counts the number
  of predictions per class.

* An ``image`` field containing a base64 encoded image string prefixed
  with a data URI (e.g. ``"data:image/jpeg;base64,...."``) representing
  the annotated image.  The client decodes this image into raw bytes for
  display.  If your workflow instead returns a binary blob when
  ``format=image`` is requested:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}, you may need to adjust the
  parsing logic accordingly.

If your workflow returns different fields (for example ``counts``
containing class counts directly, or a different key for the annotated
image), you will need to adjust the ``_parse_response`` method accordingly.
